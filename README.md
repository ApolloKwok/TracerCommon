# Tracer
Generates extensional properties orienting to inner traceable elements, 
and replaces traditional dependency injection tools like dagger, hilt, kodein and koin.

## My Words
Code in this project is probably the globally best at present for its functionality, creativity, 
difficulty, structure, efficiency, concision, and beauty. Wish you could learn from itÔºÅ

This tool would help manage memory well assuming Kotlin is without GC, because most nodes only need 
to manage its own element memories. In the near future, programming languages would be unified and 
the whole IT development structure would be rebuilt. 

My new all-powerful language would come out before Kotlin-JS and Kotlin-Native gets popular, so I 
don't plan to provide multi-platform support.

In addition to this, I have two other halfway done works and am waiting for some company to help me
make IDE plugins. I have sent resumes to common top internet companies, but those limited resume sizes
are too small and they didn't give me opportunities to display.

At last, if you are familiar with IT, feel hard to learn Kotlin and love Java or Go more, your logic 
ability mustn't be well enough for you to engage in IT. If so, do something you love and must excel 
at. I have no offensive intention, just meaning everyone has his strengths and weaknesses, and every
job has its threshold.

## Deficiency and its expected resolution by IDE

## Usage

## My atm sample needs optimized or replaced.
My atm sample misses some important details but I have no good idea to add corresponding Atm functions. 
Welcome to optimize it or donate a demo in moderate size but displaying all important details.
